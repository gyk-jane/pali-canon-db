## Download the databases
Download the pre-uploaded databases:

1. Go to the project's repository on GitHub: [link to repository](https://github.com/username/tipitaka-db)
2. Navigate to the "Databases" folder.
3. Download the desired database files.


## Generate the databases
To run the files and access the databases, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the list of dependencies in the project's `requirements.txt` file.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/username/tipitaka-db.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd tipitaka-db
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    1. Run the `main.py` file to start the application and initialize the database:
        ```
        python main.py
        ```
    2. Once the application is running, you can access the SQLite database using a tool like SQLite Browser or the command line interface. Make sure you have SQLite installed on your machine.

    That's it! You should now be able to run the files and access the databases for the `tipitaka-db` project.
